CMake Error at /opt/ros/melodic/share/catkin/cmake/catkinConfig.cmake:83 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gazebo_rosz" with
  any of the following names:

  Add the installation prefix of "gazebo_rosz" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gazebo_rosz_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "gazebo_rosz" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
